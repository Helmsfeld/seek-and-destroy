# Seek and Destroy

This is my solution to the following puzzle:

> An alien spaceship travels with constant integral velocity in one-dimensional
> discrete space. Its position and its speed are unknown. We have a laser
> gun and can choose at a given point time (which is also discrete) 
> any arbitrary position and shoot at this 
> point. We have one shot per point in time.
> If the spaceship is at this point, we have destroyed it and 
> we will know that we have destroyed it. If the spaceship wasn't there,
> we will just know that we missed.
> 
> The goal is to devise a method that will guaranteed destroy the 
> spaceship after a finite number of steps -- whatever the ships speed and
> initial position are.
